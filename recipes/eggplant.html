    <h3><em>Description:</em></h3>

    <p>
      These air fryer eggplant Parmesan rounds are oil-free, yet they are crispy
      and crunchy. All thanks to an air fryer! They are good eaten right out of
      the air fryer or topped with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese. Either
      way, they are delicious.

      <br />
      <br />
      <li>
        Dip sliced eggplant first in flour, then in beaten eggs, and finally

      <br />
      <br />
      <li>Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Place breaded eggplant rounds in the air fryer basket, making sure they
        are not touching; work in batches if necessary. Cook for 8 to 10
        minutes, flip each round, and cook until desired crispiness is achieved,
        4 to 6 minutes more.
      </li>

      <br />
      <br />

      <li>
        Top each eggplant round with marinara sauce and 1 slice of mozzarella
        cheese. Place the basket back in the air fryer and cook until cheese has
        started to melt, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining eggplant, if
        necessary.
